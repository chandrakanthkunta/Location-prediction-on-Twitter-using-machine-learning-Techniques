# <b>Location prediction on Twitter using machine learning Techniques</b>
 
The proposed framework aims to predict the location of Twitter users from tweet contents using machine learning techniques such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree. The process involves extracting relevant features from tweets, training the models using labeled data, and predicting the location of new tweets. Location prediction from tweets can provide valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, but accuracy heavily depends on the availability and quality of data.
